## About Me
### 
With a diverse background in customer service, banking, and team leadership, I bring a strong commitment to providing exceptional service and maintaining efficiency in all aspects of my work. Currently serving as a Lead Customer Service Representative at the City of Fort Collins Utilities, I assist customers with a wide range of services, including billing inquiries and account registration, ensuring prompt and professional communication. I’m also adept at managing email boxes, handling administrative tasks, and collaborating with other departments to resolve customer issues efficiently. Additionally, my leadership role has honed my interpersonal communication skills, conflict resolution abilities, and time management.

My experience at First Bank has equipped me with a robust understanding of financial processes. As a Senior Loan Representative and Notary, I manage prioritized loan efforts with minimal direction, maintain detailed reports and documentation, and work collaboratively with various teams to improve processes and resolve complex issues. In addition, I have experience in data management, supply ordering, and invoice balancing, all while ensuring accuracy and attention to detail.

With a passion for continuous learning and a focus on personal growth, I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and contribute to team success.
